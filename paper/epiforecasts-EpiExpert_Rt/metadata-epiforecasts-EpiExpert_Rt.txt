methods_long: "Forecasts of Rt from experts and non-experts are elicited using a shinyApp. \
  \ Individuals choose a distribution (default is normal) for Rt and change the \
  \ median and width of that predictive distribution for evey forecast horizon. \
  \ Based on individual forecasts, samples are drawn from the individual forecast \
  \ distributions. These samples are used to simulate cases and deaths based on a \
  \ renewal equation using the R package EpiNow2."
