### Dear `r name`,

Here are your weekly updates from the crowdforecastr project as well as a reminder to submit a forecast this week if you like. Forecasts can be made between Sunday 12am and Monday 8pm UK time (we slightly changed these times so that we can check and process all forecasts). 

You can always find more information about the project on [www.crowdforecastr.org](https://www.crowdforecastr.org). 


### Forecast and Performance overview

Now, let's have a look at last weeks forecasts and performance! Here is an overview of last week's forecasts for the locations you forecasted (or Germany, Poland and UK if you didnâ€™t make a forecast) and the ensemble forecast. Depending on the number of locations you forecasted, this might look a bit crammed. You can find more detailed information on our performance board [here](https://epiforecasts.io/crowd-evaluation). You can also find the evaluation for the European Forecast Hub [here](https://covid19forecasthub.eu/reports.html). 


```{r plot-forecasts, echo=FALSE, out.width="49%", fig.show="hold"}

*Here is the list with the current top 5 forecasters in the locations you forecasted (or Germany, Poland and UK if you didn't make a forecast), based on the last 5 weeks: *

```{r rank-table, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", eval = TRUE}

df <- data %>%
  filter(forecast_date >= cut_off)

                        summarise_by = c("model"), 
                        compute_relative_skill = TRUE)
